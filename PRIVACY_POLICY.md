## Permissions Used

| Permission                  | Why It’s Needed                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`   | Allows full access to external storage so the App can open, edit, and manage user files. This is required for the App’s core functionality. It is only used on `Android/media` to search for XCSoar (and it's forks) folders and download competition task, waypoint and airspace files to them. |
| `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`     | Lets the App read user-selected files on older Android versions for compatibility. |
| `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`    | Lets the App save or modify files on older Android versions for compatibility.   |
| `INTERNET`                  | Allows the App to connect to the internet when fetching competitions and competition task, waypoint and airspace files. |

## Your Rights
You may revoke permissions anytime in your device settings.
